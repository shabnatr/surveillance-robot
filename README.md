Robot that can be controlled from web browser
In this project, the wireless robot refers to the mini robot which live streams the monochromatic video, takes and stores the images.It is manually controlled IOT based surveillance robot. The bot is being controlled through a local WiFi server by a compatible webpage. The objective of the proposed project is to implement the afore-mentioned technology pertaining to the mini robot which is capable of performing multiple tasks at an aï¬€ordable cost. Raspberry-Pi Based Robot Control Board will be used to design the robot. In this project, we have proposed a surveillance robot with the facility of real time video streaming,and ability to avoid obstacles in the process. The system will be designed as such to stream the video live to the person monitoring the bot. It uses PIR, humidity, gas sensors for detecting movements of humans or animals, temperature, humidity and presence of poisonous gase respectively. It uses a motor which has the capability to move the bot in all directions and we can control it through the webpage. It is having four ultrasonic sensor connected in four direction for measuring the distance from all four directions, so as to change the movements from obstacles. For giving more protection to the bot it has a battery module which notify the charge capacity of bot to the user.
